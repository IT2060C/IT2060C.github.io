### In-Class Assignments

Assignments are given in-class and are due at the end of the class period.

### Quizzes

Quizzes will test your knowledge of the material covered in class.

### Labs

Labs will have you practice the skills learned in class by running SQL statements on a database, and then completing a series of questions about those queries.

### Final Project

The final project is designed to assess your ability to use the skills and knowledge learned throughout the course. The project contains two parts, one using a Linux System and one using a Windows Server system. The final project instructions are available to view at any time but must be completed by the due date specified. A more detailed explanation will be given at the end of the semester when the project is assigned.

You are free to use any resource to help complete the project, excluding the instructor. Think of the project as an open world test. You may use your notes, ask for help from others, or even use the Internet.
